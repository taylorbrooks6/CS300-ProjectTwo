#  Project One – Data Structures Analysis  
**Author:** Taylor Brooks

##  Overview
The goal of Project One was to compare multiple data structures—**vector**, **hash table**, and **binary search tree (BST)**—to determine which would be the most efficient and practical for storing and retrieving course information in the university advising program.  
The chosen structure would later be implemented in Project Two to display courses in alphanumeric order and support prerequisite lookups.

##  Runtime and Memory Analysis

| **Data Structure** | **Load & Parse** | **Search Course** | **Print All Courses** | **Memory Usage** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|---------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **Vector** | O(n) | O(n) | O(n log n) | O(n) | Simple and easy to implement | Linear search slows down with large datasets |
| **Hash Table** | O(n)| O(1) avg, O(n) worst  | O(n log n)  | O(n) | Very fast search and insert | Worst-case collisions can degrade performance; not sorted |
| **Binary Search Tree (BST)** | O(n log n)  | O(log n) | O(n)  | O(n) | Automatically maintains sorted order; efficient search | Unbalanced BST may degrade to O(n) |

##  Recommendation
After analyzing performance and memory characteristics, the **Binary Search Tree (BST)** was selected for implementation in Project Two.  

Use a Binary Search Tree because it maintains courses in sorted order and provides efficient search. 
A Hash Table is faster for individual lookups but requires additional steps to print courses alphabetically. A Vector is simplest but inefficient for large datasets.

##  Reflection Summary
This project reinforced the importance of choosing the right data structure for a task.
It highlighted how understanding algorithmic efficiency affects runtime performance, memory usage, and overall program design clarity.
By analyzing multiple data structures, I gained insight into balancing simplicity, speed, and functionality in software development.
